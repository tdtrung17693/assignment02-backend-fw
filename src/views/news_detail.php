                Announcing The Outriders GeForce RTX Laptop Bundle
            </h1>
            <p>People Can Fly and Square Enix’s Outriders has been showered in praise since the release of its demo in February, with players loving the world, high-stakes combat loop, and the gameplay in general. The demo has received over 2 million downloads
                in its first week, and since then, the game’s been riding high in the Steam Top 10 sellers list ahead of its April 1st release. The full launch will add NVIDIA DLSS to the game, enabling players to reach super high frame rates that make
                their superhuman characters more responsive, animation smoother, visuals clearer, and everything that bit better.
            </p>

            <p>The addition of NVIDIA DLSS comes courtesy of an Outriders partnership we unveiled back in January, but there’s more: we’re now offering a digital Steam copy of Outriders to buyers of eligible GeForce RTX laptops at participating partners.
            </p>

            <p>
                GeForce RTX laptops and NVIDIA DLSS give you the performance to play Outriders at higher frame rates making them perfect for enjoying Outriders anywhere, anytime. GeForce RTX laptops also boast Max-Q technologies like Dynamic Boost and WhisperMode, which
                utilize AI and system optimizations, making these gaming laptops faster than ever. And with the launch of our Ampere-architecture GeForce RTX 30 Series laptops, our 3rd Gen Max-Q technologies give you faster performance, longer battery
                life, and quieter acoustics. Learn more here.
